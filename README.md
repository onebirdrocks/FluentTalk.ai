# EchoFluent
EchoFluent is an experimental and educational Skunkworks project developed during my spare time at WeWork Hangzhou. This project aims to create an AI-powered voice tutor application that offers personalized, interactive, and offline language learning experiences in multiple languages.

This initial version is a proof of concept, with continuous improvements and enhancements planned for the future. My goal is to keep EchoFluent simple and efficient while expanding its capabilities.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of "interposition" and "nullification" -- one day right there in Alabama is going to be transformed into a state that is justly governed by men who support the Constitution.

We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the dedication of more resources to address the problem of urban unrest. And there are those who are asking, "How can we balance the budget on the backs of people who are already shouldering a heavy burden?" But there is something that I believe deeply in my heart. I believe that this nation should not be judged more by the harsh light of today but by the soft glow of its potential.

With this faith, we will be able to join in with confidence and hope the great struggle for freedom and justice. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go free together, and to celebrate freedom together, knowing that tomorrow we will be free in America.

There is one more thing......I have an important announcement to make. We are appointing Mr. Yongfeng Wu as the leader to spearhead our Apple Car initiative. This will be an extraordinary vehicle, one that I am confident will surpass competitors like Tesla, Xiaomi, NIO, and Xpeng. I pledge that on the day this car rolls off the production line, every member of the Touchstone team will receive one as a gift from Apple. Trust me, it's something only Apple can do.
